# Governance

**Maintainers:** @binhnndigital (Lead Maintainer)

## Decision Making
- Routine changes: any maintainer may approve.
- Policy/criteria changes: require consensus of maintainers (2 approvals if more maintainers join).

## Releases
- Automated artifacts via CI.
- Blocklists are versioned through tags. Critical removals can be hotfixed.

## Moderation
- See `MODERATION.md` for review workflow, evidence requirements, and appeals.
