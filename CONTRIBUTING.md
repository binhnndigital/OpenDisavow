# Contributing to OpenDisavow

Thanks for your interest in contributing!

## How to contribute

1. **Propose changes** via Issues first whenever possible.
2. **Add domains** using the Issue template `ISSUE_TEMPLATE/new_domain.md`. Provide evidence (logs, screenshots, URLs).
3. **Open a Pull Request** that updates `data/domains.csv` and, if relevant, `rules/heuristics.yaml`.
4. **Pass CI**: validation must succeed and `tools/merge_and_build.py` must produce a `build/disavow.txt`.

## Code of Conduct

Be respectful, avoid defamatory language. Use neutral phrasing like “indicative of low-quality per criteria X”.

## License status

**Temporary**: License **TBD**. Until explicitly licensed, all rights reserved by the author.
Contributions may be re-licensed in the future when the project chooses an official license.
